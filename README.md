# Random Quote Machine  (React)

This is a slight modification of a project that I made on CodePen: [https://codepen.io/rowjw/pen/oNqWGMG](https://codepen.io/rowjw/pen/oNqWGMG).
I have combined the React random quote generator with a JavaScript mismatched quotes generator that I previously made. You can find [the repo](https://github.com/r-jeffery-wall/mismatched_quote_generator) for that script on my GitHub.

The result is an inspirational quotes generator that returns a jumbled mess of quotes, which I find quite amusing because I have the sense of humour of a child.
